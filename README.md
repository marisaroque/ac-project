 Project
-
The project Space Battle intends to develop a game with Assembly language for the Special Processor for Education [(PEPE)](ac-project/simulator.jar) in the scope of Computer Architecture discipline.

Goal
-
The aim of this project is to create a space battle game.
The game consists of a ship controlled by the player and several aliens autonomously controlled. The aliens move from time to time towards the ship to destroy it.

The ship has a canon with limited range to attack the aliens. The ship can move in eight directions, rotate the canon in two directions and fire the cannon.

The ship has energy that is consumed while moving and firing. On the other hand, it recovers energy while destroying an alien.
The game ends once there’s no energy left, by colliding with an alien or by player’s choice.

The chosen keys to move the ship are 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 and A. To rotate the canon, the chosen keys are C and D. Keys 3, 7, and B are used to suspend, end and restart the game, respectively.
